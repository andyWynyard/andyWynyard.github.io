				<h4>
					What is the difference between ‘switch’ and ‘if/else’? When would you use one versus  the other?
				</h4>
				<p> They are used in very similar scenarios. Switch seems to be a bit quicker to write out, but is less quickly understood. </p>
			</div>
			<br>
			<div class="card">
				<h4>
					When would you use ‘=’ vs ‘==’ vs ‘.equals’? Explain what each of these does and in  which cases you should use them. 
				</h4>
				<p>The '=' is the assignment operator. The '==' operator is used to query if these two values are equal to one another. .equals() is actually a method that compares values, to be used for Strings. This then allows you to find if something is true or not.</p>

				<h3>
					To generate a random number you use ‘Math.random()’. What is ‘Math’? What is the  return type of the ‘.random()’ method. Why is the ‘M’ in ‘Math’ capitalized (you may  need to investigate Static classes...hint hint). 
				</h3>
				<p>Random returns a double between 0 and 1, and can be used to generate a random number for the purposes of simulating an AI. Math is a class thats been around since JDK1.0, and as such it is old. Seems like an old naming convention. Math class is final and all of its memebers are static. </p>

			<br>
			<div class="card">
				<h3>
					What does it mean to ‘cast a double to an int’? Give an example of when you would do this and explain what is happening. 
				</h3>
				<p>When a double is cast to an int, the decimal places are taken away. Also, the memory allocation is much smaller on an int. 
				</p>

			<div class="card">
				<h3>
					What is the difference between a ‘for’, ‘while’ and ‘do while’ loop? Give an example of  when you would use one versus another. What is the benefit of a ‘do while’ over a  ‘while’? 
				</h3>
				<p>A for loop is often used when you know how many times you want to loop the function. The do while and while loop have conditions that allow the loop to continue untill the condition is met.
				</p>
			</div>
			<br>
			<div class="card">
				<h3>
					What happens when you include ‘import java.util.Scanner;’ in your code? Where does  this functionality come from? What is the ‘java’ in ‘java.util.Scanner;’? 
				</h3>
				<p>This allows you to take input from a keyboard device.
				</p>

			<div class="card">
				<h3>
					What is ‘void’ in a method declaration? How does this differ from declaring a method  with a return type? 
				</h3>
				<p>void means that the method will not return anything.
				</p>
			</div>
			<br>
			<div class="card">
				<h3>
					When it comes to methods, what is the difference between a “parameter” and an  “argument”? Is there one? When would you use one versus the other?
				</h3>
				<p>A parameter is a variable that is within the method definition. An argument is passed into the method's parameter to manipulate data via the tool that is the method.
