					What is the difference between ‘switch’ and ‘if/else’? When would you use one versus  the other?
				</h3>
				<p> They are used in very similar scenarios. Switch seems to be a bit quicker to write out, but less understandable. </p>

				<h3>
					When would you use ‘=’ vs ‘==’ vs ‘.equals’? Explain what each of these does and in  which cases you should use them. 
				</h3>
				<p>The '=' is is used to assign a value. The '==' operator is used to query if these two values are equal to one another. .equals() is actually a method that compares values, to be used for Strings. This then allows you to find if something is true or not.</p>

				<h3>
					To generate a random number you use ‘Math.random()’. What is ‘Math’? What is the  return type of the ‘.random()’ method. Why is the ‘M’ in ‘Math’ capitalized (you may  need to investigate Static classes...hint hint). 
				</h3>
				<p>Random returns a double between 0 and 1, and can be used to generate a random number for the purposes of simulating an AI. Math is a class thats been around since JDK1.0, and as such it is old. Seems like an old naming convention. Math class is final and all of its memebers are static. </p>

					What is the difference between a ‘for’, ‘while’ and ‘do while’ loop? Give an example of  when you would use one versus another. What is the benefit of a ‘do while’ over a  ‘while’?

					What happens when you include ‘import java.util.Scanner;’ in your code? Where does  this functionality come from? What is the ‘java’ in ‘java.util.Scanner;’?

					What is ‘void’ in a method declaration? How does this differ from declaring a method  with a return type?

					When it comes to methods, what is the difference between a “parameter” and an  “argument”? Is there one? When would you use one versus the other?
